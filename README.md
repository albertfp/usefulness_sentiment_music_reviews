# Sentiment and usefulness classification for music reviews

Author: Albert Fullana Puig


Recently, there exists a tendency to buy and rent on the Internet. Customers rely on reviews to decide whether to purchase or not. As there can be hundreds of reviews per product, the need of ranking and classifying them has arisen.
This thesis aims to predict usefulness together with sentiment, i.e. useful vs. not useful review and sentiment polarity, in the specific case of music reviews. To perform this task, Natural Language Processing (NLP) together with novel deep learning techniques, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have been used. This work performs a comparison between different text pre-processing techniques for binary classification of sentiment and usefulness. Formerly, extracting text features was a hard task and required expertise in linguistics. The proposed architectures in this study allow the search for relevant semantic and syntactic features without the need of an expert. Finally, a first approach that uses sentiment information, coming from a trained model, in usefulness classification tasks is tested.
Experimental results show some interesting aspects of the sentiment and usefulness classification problems nature, e.g. the difficulty in finding interesting features for usefulness compared to finding those for sentiment.
